## Purpose of this notebook:

Throughout the Data Science curriculum at Codeup, we learned a variety of programming languages, either indirectly due to need (HTML5 and Markdown), or directly through instruction (Python 3 and SQL).

The entire second half of the course, however, was dedicated to Data Science practices and procedures, which involved working with several of Python's vast library of resources, namely Pandas, Numpy, and SKLearn.

While I am confident in navigating vast DataFrames and mining for information, I can't say the same for a live Python coding interview / web class. If someone were to ask me to whiteboard some Python, working out the logic - I feel - would seem a bit chaotic and messy. Despite its prominence in Data Science, Python in Pandas is pretty specific and repetitive - you work with DataFrames so much, your Python can get too niche - the language can do a whole lot more than just parse through columns for data.

To use a sports analogy: the best players in the NFL haven't just played football their entire lives, they've played basketball, baseball, and other things as well. Python and Data Science is no different: if I want to be a better Data Scientist, I need to try Python in some capacity other than data manipulation. I may never dunk a basketball and my Python code may never send the next Space-X rocket into its next mission, but I feel a repository where I'm just hitting the Python gym will make me better overall.
